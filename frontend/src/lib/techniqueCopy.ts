      "A more extended arm at contact helps you hit through the shuttle with a longer lever and cleaner power transfer.",

      "Reach tall through contact — finish the swing with a longer arm before you wrap.",

  LOW_KNEE_CONTRIBUTION: {
    title: "Use more leg drive",
    whatHappened:
      "Your knees contributed less upward drive into the swing than the reference group.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Leg drive sets the rhythm for the rest of the stroke and helps you hit up through the shuttle, not just with the arm.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Load the legs in preparation, then drive up as the swing starts.",

  PREPARATION_KNEE_OUT_OF_RANGE: {
    title: "Adjust your ready bend",
    whatHappened:
      "Your knee bend in preparation sat outside the usual range for this stroke.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A stable ready bend makes it easier to time the jump or push into the swing.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Settle into a comfortable athletic bend before the racket starts back.",
  },
  POOR_ARM_ACCELERATION_TIMING: {
    title: "Your arm sequence is out of sync",
    whatHappened:
      "The peak of your elbow speed arrived at a different moment relative to contact than the reference group.",
    whyItMatters:
      "When elbow and wrist peak in a smoother order, contact feels cleaner and less rushed.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Let the upper arm start the whip, then let the hand catch up through contact.",
  },
  LOW_CONTACT_POSTURE: {
    title: "Contact point is too low",
    whatHappened:
      "Your racket-side hand met the shuttle lower than the reference group’s typical contact height.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Contacting higher usually means better clearance and a stronger, more attacking geometry.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Get under the shuttle earlier so you can meet it higher in front of you.",
  },
  WEAK_FOLLOW_THROUGH: {
    title: "Finish the swing more fully",
    whatHappened:
      "Your racket hand slowed down sooner after contact than the reference group.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A fuller finish keeps you committed through the hit instead of cutting the stroke short.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Stay through the shuttle and let the swing unwind across the body.",
  },
  LIMITED_CLEAR_PREPARATION: {
    title: "Preparation is too compact",
    whatHappened:
      "Your clear setup looked tighter than the reference group — less room in the arm or legs before the swing.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A clearer preparation gives you space to accelerate upward and hit a higher, deeper clear.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Open the ready position earlier — create space with the racket arm before you accelerate.",
  },
  INSUFFICIENT_ARM_EXTENSION: {
    title: "Extend more at contact",
    whatHappened:
      "Your arm was less extended at estimated contact than players in the clear reference group.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Fuller extension at contact helps send the shuttle higher and deeper without muscling the wrist alone.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Reach long through contact as if you are throwing the shuttle to the back court.",
  },
  POOR_PROXIMAL_DISTAL_TIMING: {
    title: "Your arm sequence is out of sync",
    whatHappened:
      "The order of your elbow and wrist speed peaks did not match the usual clear timing pattern.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A smoother arm sequence helps you hit up through the shuttle instead of dumping it flat.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Start the whip from the elbow, then let the hand accelerate through a high contact.",
  },
  RESTRICTED_FOLLOW_THROUGH: {
    title: "Finish the clear more freely",
    whatHappened:
      "After contact, your racket hand did not carry through as freely as the reference group.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A freer finish supports an upward clear path and keeps you balanced for the next shot.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Stay tall through the hit and let the racket continue past your opposite hip.",
  },
  SLOW_RECOVERY: {
    title: "Get ready for the next shot sooner",
    whatHappened:
      "It took longer than usual for your motion to settle back toward a ready position after the clear.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Faster recovery keeps you available for the reply instead of stuck in the finish.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Land soft, bring the racket back to ready, and find your base quickly.",
  },
  KINETIC_CHAIN_ORDER: {
    title: "Your arm may be leading the shoulder",
    whatHappened:
      "In this swing your elbow seemed to reach its fastest speed before your shoulder did.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Power usually builds from the body outward: shoulder first, then elbow, then hand. Starting with the arm can cost speed.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Start the swing by turning the shoulder, and let the elbow and hand follow.",
  },
  LOW_CONTACT_POINT: {
    title: "Contact may be below head height",
    whatHappened:
      "At the estimated contact moment your racket hand looked lower than your head.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Overhead strokes are usually hit with the arm reaching above the head, which gives a steeper, stronger angle.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Move under the shuttle earlier so you can reach up and hit it above your head.",
  },
  LATE_ELBOW_ACCELERATION: {
    title: "Your elbow may be accelerating late",
    whatHappened:
      "Your elbow seemed to reach its fastest speed a little after the estimated contact moment.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Peak arm speed is most useful at or just before contact, not after the shuttle has gone.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Time the whip so the arm is at full speed as you meet the shuttle.",
  },
  LOW_RACKET_PREPARATION: {
    title: "Racket preparation may be low",
    whatHappened:
      "At the end of your backswing your racket hand looked lower than your shoulder.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Getting the racket up early gives you room to swing up and through the shuttle.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Lift the racket hand to shoulder height or above as you turn to prepare.",
  },
  BENT_ELBOW_AT_CONTACT: {
    title: "Your elbow may be quite bent at contact",
    whatHappened:
      "From the side view your elbow looked quite bent at the estimated contact moment.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A strongly bent elbow can shorten your reach. Some bend is normal, especially on fast smashes.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Check on video whether you are reaching up to the shuttle or letting it drop onto you.",
  },
  LIMITED_LEG_DRIVE: {
    title: "You may be using little leg drive",
    whatHappened:
      "From the side view your knees straightened very little from your deepest bend to contact.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Pushing up through the legs helps start the swing and adds to its power.",
    coachingFocus:
      "Bend a little more in preparation, then push up as the swing starts.",
  },
  STIFF_PREPARATION_KNEE: {
    title: "Your knees may be quite straight in preparation",
    whatHappened:
      "From the side view your knees looked almost straight while you were getting ready.",
    whyItMatters:
      "A slight knee bend makes it easier to move to the shuttle and push into the swing.",
